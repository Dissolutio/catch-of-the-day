# My first React App!

I built this app by following along with the course [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) made by Wes Bos.
I am hosting my project at netlify. So all you need to do is:

1. Go to [https://seafood-store.netlify.com](https://seafood-store.netlify.com/)
2. Click "Visit Store"
   ![visit store](/public/app-screenshots/screen.PNG)
3. Login Anonymously, or with Github, Twitter, or Facebook
   ![visit store](/public/app-screenshots/screen0.PNG)
4. Click "load sample fishes" in the inventory section
   ![visit store](/public/app-screenshots/screen1.PNG)
5. Try adding some fish to your order, or changing fish in the inventory!
   ![visit store](/public/app-screenshots/screen2.PNG)

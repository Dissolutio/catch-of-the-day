<h1>My first React App!</h1>
<p>I built this app by following along with the course <a href="https://reactforbeginners.com/">React for Beginners</a> made by Wes Bos.
I am hosting my project at netlify. So all you need to do is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://seafood-store.netlify.com/">https://seafood-store.netlify.com/</a></li>
  <li>Click "Visit Store"</li>
  <li>Login with either Github, Twitter, or Facebook</li>
  <li>Click "load sample fishes" in the inventory section</li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>

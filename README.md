# My first React App!

I built this app by following along with the course [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) made by Wes Bos.
I am hosting my project at netlify. So all you need to do is:

1. Go to [https://seafood-store.netlify.com](https://seafood-store.netlify.com/)
2. Click "Visit Store"
3. Login Anonymously, or with Github, Twitter, or Facebook
4. Click "load sample fishes" in the inventory section
5. Try adding some fish your order, or chaning fish in the inventory!

Thanks for visiting!
